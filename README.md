ABSTRACT OF THE PROJECT:
This project aims to develop an automated malaria detection system using advanced deep learning techniques to improve accuracy and efficiency. By analyzing blood smear images, the system rapidly identifies malaria-infected cells, providing fast and reliable results in the form of report. It reduces the dependency on manual microscopy, ensuring scalability and accessibility in low-resource settings. The solution offers a cost-effective, accurate alternative to traditional methods, potentially revolutionizing malaria diagnostics and saving lives.
